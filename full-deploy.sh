# This script is responsible for deploying a full-blown development enrironment
# on remote machines. I only want this to work on ubuntu.

# TODO: latest (or fixed) version of nvim with only some of my plugins
# TODO: python3, fixed version of clang binaries
# TODO: development utils (make and other stuff)
# TODO: everything else from `deploy.sh`
# TODO: my own bin directory (perhaps in .local) with symlinks to all the
# binaries I need (e.g. clangd)
# TODO: add CLANG13 and other shit to .bashrc
